		<h1>lived experiences project title</h1>
		<p>I am now a mechanical Engineering Major student; I think I am going to start a higher studying level after graduating from collage. Not because that engineers who have a master degree is easier to get a job but because the field I interested in requires a lot of professional skills and knowledge.  After getting a master degree I would try to work on a company that have AI project like Google Company as a start plan.  Working in real condition is the best way to examine the skills that we learned at college and also working in a company is like a new studying progress, which we can learn a lot during it. It is also a process to raise money and experiences. After that I am going to start a new company of mine focus on AI, which is my future career track planed by myself.</p>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is a newly appeared technique in 21st century. It is developed with a high speed, and now we can find it in most part of our life. We use SIRI—the voice assistant in iPhones, we use the navigator in automobiles—smartly choose a nearest way for the driver. And incoming Google glasses—a new generation of daily life assistant. I personally like them so much because they make our life a lot more convenient than before. I can free our hand to call someone because phones can hear our commands, and also Google is researching a new kind of car that no driver is needed when driving it, I am not experiencing it but I feel that I like it too much, the AI engineer is going to be the coolest guys in the future.</p>
        <p>The specific piece of technology that impacted me to choose Mechanical Engineering was Artificial Intelligence technique. I think it is the coolest thing in twenty first century.  I saw a lot of fiction movies during my spare time, like The Terminator, WALL·E, and Star Wars… and there are lot robots in these movies that impressed me so much, like 3PO and R2D2 in star war. The robots cannot only simulate human beings but also can do so many stuff that we cannot do. For example R2D2 is like a daily functional robot, its job is doing some repairing spaceships and hacking enemies   system. It communicates with people and has their own thought. Another robot 3PO is a social communication robot he can think by himself and talk to its owner. It is cool and it is my dream to build a real robot and Mechanical Engineering is a major that studying force and mechanical so I choose Mechanical engineering.I am so into that kind of movie that I collect so many toy figurines that filled my toy box when I was a kid.</p>
        <p>When I was in primary school I was so crazy about going to local museum. And the only purpose for me to go there is that there are lot robot exhibitions. My favorite one is a talking robot that has an Einstein looking. People can ask him questions and he can answer it in human voice. I remembered that I asked him a lot like “what is your name? Date of birth? What is your job”? Mostly the robot answer people’s questions in good manners but sometimes it just tell some joke to make us laugh. It almost the most advanced robot in that museum. It is so funny once I asked it a lot question and he answered like” can I get a cup of water after so much talking?”</p>
        <p>I used to join a programing group in my high school to learn some basic programing skills, once made a game like ‘little bunny collect carrots’ with Flash software and urns out that lot of my friend like it. I spent a week to finish that game and thought if I had more knowledge about programing, may be it is not so hard to write code for a robot. As far as I did it in MSU at EGR100 course with LEGO robot, there is still a lot to be learned.</p>
        <p>And also I think that Artificial Intelligence is going to become a new popular field in industry and business area.  I read a lot of news about techniques and notice that AI is about to becoming a part of people’s life.  For example nowadays almost everyone is using a smart phone. The reason we call it smartphone is because the communications between user and phone are more effective, we can use voice control to call someone or open an app or setting alarm clock, the phone can hear us and know what we would like to do. And Google company is now researching some new products which is all related to the techniques of artificial intelligence like: Google glass and Google car. More convenient life and business assistance and cars do not need a driver.  In the future I think there should be more AI product in our life, and AI specialist is a good job.</p>
        <p>There is one more advantage that can be the reason I like AI and choose Mechanical Engineering as my major. Through the studying of industry history I found that AI should be a new industry revolution. As we all know that the fist time industry revolution was about the steam power; it provide a power solution for the factory at that time. When it comes to the second industry revolution, the electric power and internal combustion engine was introduced. It provides a better power solution again to promote the efficiency. The third one is the information revolution. During the history engineers and scientist were trying them best to promote the efficiency of factories or companies. They never stopped finding ways that could reduce the cost of a product and improve the profit. And AI is a new way to get this purpose. For example: If a manager is hiring workers in the factory, the company has to pay salaries to them, also need a management team to make things work. It is going to be a huge budget, and all the money is going to count into the cost. But if the companies is hiring robot to replace worker, the cost is only going to be the payment for the electric supply. So the company’s keeper, businesses men would love to buy them, so AI has a good future market.</p>
        <p>So that is almost the reason I choose this career path. Nothing is easy unless we do it, I believe my ME major in college is a good start for the path.</p>
