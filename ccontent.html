			<h1>about me</h1>
			<p>In the movie ‘3 idiots’ tells a story about three good friends--- Farhan, Raju and Ranchho, who share a room in the residence of the fictional Imperial College of Engineering (ICE). All three of them are engineering major in college. However, Farhan studies engineering to purse his father’s wishes, Raju is studying for his family to get out of poverty. On the other hand, Ranchho studies engineering for his own simple passion about machines and enjoy the fun with it. </p>
            <p>The movie describes a world that the competition between people is extremely hard. People fall into competition as soon as they were born. Every boy was expected to be an engineer in Indian’s family. </p>
            <p>Ranchho is the rule-breaker : he just study for just one thing—his passion for engineering, and at last he not only makes himself success but also helped his friend --- Farhan and Raju to find their passion and then get success as well.( Sarita Tanwar (2011). .

            <p>There are some other guys who are not with them; one is Dr. Viru, the college director, who always sneer their approach.  Another is Viru’s favorite’s student, Chatur, who believes in mindless memorizing over understanding to reach his goals of corporate status. They studies or works in a different way, For example: Chatur studies only by remembering the word in textbooks without knowing its means. May be he can get good grades through it; however the process of studying in that way is not happy. I called it memorizing but not learning.</p>
            <p>So the same issue in the real world. Nowadays students seem less motived by their career because most of them have not thought about their passions.  I have a friend Dave who used to be in the applied science major and I went to the class with him and during class he plays games on his phone rarely concern about our professor. On the second semester he told me that he changed his major to law. I asked him why he chosen that major his answer is just because it is easy to get a job after graduated, but not because his interest or curiosity.</p>
            <p>Nowadays a lot of students do not try hard on their assignment because they are not passionate with it or we can say that they are not so desire to learn. So that’s why they do not do homework until the due days.</p>
            <p>And also, In companies there are always some employees that looks so lazy during their working time, they put off too many stuff on schedule to complete their work, Some are lucky that they complete their work others are not lucky that they takes the risk to lose their job.</p>
            <p>Then we are going to ask:” Why is that?” The answer is that they or we lost our passion to work; some of us even lost our dreams. So that we just spend the time but not make good advantage of time, it is us who make every day to be normal--- there is no specials for each days and no surprise. Then every normal day is composing people’s life, and then people will not enjoy their life.</p>
            <p>Albert Einstein Said that Interest is the best teacher. If one has interests in something then he cannot help to think about it, all day long, he can focus his thought on that stuff. If one can focus on one subject for a longer time like several years then that one is going to be an expert about it, which is success without painfully memorizing textbooks.</p>
            <p>In college male students are enjoying playing online combat games, like DOTA and league of legend, some of them are so into it that they spend four or five hours a day to play it. Sometimes they will watch some video records of these games to learn from other players. And then come back to the game to practice the control skill just learned. I am not a game player so to me this is so crazy but the players enjoy it. And if they are offline they often talk about their friend about the game playing,  communicating and exchanging ideas about how the strategies and skills of the game, In my eyes, these players are so successful in the game world and they deserve it for the great passion---some of them can play it without sleeping. </p>
            <p>The process for them to study about game is similar to study about class. The video watching is like taking courses in class. The game playing is practice so like the homework, and chatting with friend is the same function with group meeting in school.  All elements are the same but only one is different: the Passion. </p>
            <p>They desire to make progress on game but not so much in study. Here is the problem. So the key to fix this social issue is to improve the desire for student to learn, improve the passion for employees to work. </p>
            <p>According to the analysis above, my proposed solution is reducing the outer stress for students and gives them more space to think about them themselves.  We can achieve that through following steps:</p>
            <p>1.	Reducing the number of exams for a semester.   Exams and home works due are the two main reasons that cause students to feel stressed out.  Too many exams and homework makes student feel like they are pushed by the exam. It makes student lazy, they are going to thinks like they only studies for the exam, they will not desire to learn if there are no exam and home works. A pleasant studying process should be like the students are pushed by their own interest and study, and then feel success.</p>
            <p>2.	Encourage students to try more clubs to allow them to find their own interest. One of the biggest problems in student group is that most of them cannot find their passion about. They play online games because they feel success in it. To lead them to a correct way, we need them to join some student club to allow them to find their advantage and feel success.  People always keep interest to something that they feel success with.</p>
            <p>3.	Give students more spare time. I thought the most efficient way to study is study by their own, It can improve the ability for students to solve problems.  Here I referenced some tips for Ways To Motivate Students To Learn:</p>
            <p>If the proposed solution is used the anticipated result is that the student feels more comfortable studying by themselves. After graduating from college and they go to work, they will have more passion and more successful career life.</p>
            <p> The conclusion is that to improve the efficient of studying and make a successful future, we should find passion for our work.</p>
